## Scarlet Rising
This is a short puzzle platformer where you play as a girl named Scarlet and navigate the world using teleporting projectiles. The game was built within the [Unity](https://unity.com/) over the course of two months. 

## Motivation
This game was the final project for my group game project course. I wanted to push my skills to the limits with this project and see what I was capable of producing for this project.
